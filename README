Class::ActsLike
--------------

Version 1.00, Thu Jul  7 04:42:26 UTC 2005

This module is a thin, backwards compatible wrapper around Class::Roles, the
module which does more and you should use instead.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

There is also a Makefile.PL, but I don't use it.
